## Exploring Adversarial examples: Robust and Non-Robust features of pictures 

Team 25

Understanding adversarial examples is highly important problem in image classification, and due to it a lot ofresearch nowadays is connected to it. In our project we demonstrate that features in image classification problemcan be divided into robust and non-robust.  And the existence of non-robust features leads to the existence ofadversarial example. Based on the theoretical description of such features, we establish their widespread existencein standard datasets.
