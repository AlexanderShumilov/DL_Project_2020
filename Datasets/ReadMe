During our project we created several robust and non-robust datasets for several base datasets (CIFAR-10, Simpsons), Number of elements is different, so is the weight of corresponding files. All '*.pt' files have names corresponding to ines that used in notebooks, but path to them always be different (we run experiments mounting colab on our google disks), so please make sure that code is modified correctly.
